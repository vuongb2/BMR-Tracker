## Project Status
Project is: _complete_. This is my first ever personal front-end project and experience with HTML/JS.


## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- The BMR calculator is not fully accurate as it requires the users BMI and activity level in its calculations, but provides a good general idea.

To do:
- Add activity level capabilities and a BMI slider
