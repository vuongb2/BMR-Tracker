## General Information
-This is my first ever front-end development project where I experimented with HTML, CSS, and JS. The intended purpose was to expose me to field and gain experience for UW Informatics 442. The project taught me basic fundamentals such as:
- HTML is the skeleton/framework, JS is the "muscle" (functional code), and CSS is the "skin" (styling)
- how to manipulate constants, divs, forms, inputs across files
- basic HTML syntax
- I have prior experience with CSS and Java, making the syntax very intuitive prior to this project


## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## Usage
The user may input their own details into the various queries on the page to view their ideal calorie intake target


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_. This is my first ever personal front-end project and experience with HTML/JS.


## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- The BMR calculator is not fully accurate as it requires the users BMI and activity level in its calculations, but provides a good general idea.

To do:
- Add activity level capabilities and a BMI slider
